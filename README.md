## About Projects:
### Project One: 
### Amazon's Sales Data Analysis [Dashboard] [

### Problem Statement:
Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the
need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales
management today is the most important function in a commercial and business
enterprise.

Do ETL: Extract-Transform-Load some Amazon dataset and find for me
Sales-trend -> month-wise, year-wise, yearly_month-wise
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between
attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings

### Objective:
Led an in-depth analysis of Amazon sales data to address the challenges of increasing competition and optimize distribution methods.
Conducted ETL processes on a comprehensive dataset, leveraging Tableau for advanced data visualization and analysis.

### About Dataset:
The dataset consists of 14 columns, each column representing an attribute of sales on a item -

- Region - Geographical region where order is placed
- Country - Represents the country assosiated with the order placed
- Item type - Describes the type of item sold
- Sales channel - Indicates the channel through which the sales was made

- Units sold - Represents the quantity of units sold in each order
- Units price - Denotes the price of single unit of the item
- Units cost - Represents the cost incurred to produce a single unit of item
- Total revenue - Calculated as product of 'units sold' and 'units proce'.It represents the total revenue generated from the sale.
- Total cost - Calculated as product of 'units sold' and 'units cost'.It represents the total cost generated from the sale.
- Total profit - Calculated as the difference between 'Total revenue' and 'Toatl cost'. It represents the total profit generated from the sale.

**Cleaning and Preprocessing the data:**

  For this project, we performed data analysis using Tableau, utilizing visualization technique. Here's what I did:

  1.Data Loading: We loaded the dataset using Tableau's data connector from the source.
  
  2.Data type : In the data source tab, manually verify that Tableau has correctly assigned data types to each column.

**Creating Dashboard:**

 Sales Trend Analysis:
 - Visualization type: Line chart and bar chart
 - Purpose: Showcase the overall sales trend over the selected time period.
  
 Best selling products:
 - Visualization type: Horizontal bar chart
 - Purpose: Identify top performing products contributing to overall sales.

 Sales distribution among different items:
 - Visualization type: Pie chart
 - Purpose: Analyze sales distribution of different items

 Trend analysis by Sales Channel:
 - Visualization type: Pie chart
 - Purpose: Compare sales trend across sales channels

 Monthly and Yearly Unit Sales:
 - Visualization type: Column chart
 - Purpose: Enables to understand unit sales over month and year

 Revenue distributions among different regions:
 - Visualization type: Horizontal bar chart
 - Purpose: Compare revenue region wise

 MoM and YoY sales growth rates:
 - Visualization type: Line chart
 - Purpose: Analyze MoM and YoY sales growth rate

### Insights:

Here are the key insights from our Sales Data Analysis:

1.The best-selling product analysis identifies Cosmetics as the top performer, 
  showcasing its strong market demand and profitability.

2.The analysis of sales channels highlights the effectiveness of online platforms, 
  suggesting the need for increased investment in online marketing and e-commerce strategies.

  review of market strategies and operational efficiency.

5.The year-month sales trend illustrates fluctuating patterns, with notable peaks in specific months.

6.The distribution of revenue among different regions showcases a clear disparity, 
  with Region Sub-Saharan Africa driving the majority of sales.

7.The distribution of profit among the top 10 countries reveals significant variations, 
  with Country Djibouti leading in profit generation.


  ### Project Two:
  ### Financial Analytics

  ### Problem Statement:
  Without analyzing the competition, it is difficult for a business to survive. You are
  tasked to analyse the competition for the management to provide better results. This
  data set has information on the market capitalization of the top 500 companies in India.
  Serial NumberNameName of CompanyMar Cap – CroreMarket Capitalization in
  CroresSales Qtr – CroreQuarterly Sale in crores. Find key metrics and factors and
  show the meaningful relationships between attributes.
  Do your own research and come up with your findings

  ### Objective:
  Conducted an in-depth financial analysis of the top 500 companies in India, leveraging Python for data cleaning,& 
  statistical analysis Key tasks included identifying and rectifying missing or inconsistent data, exploring the 
  relationship between sales and market capitalization, performing regression analysis for predictive insights, and 
  profiling top-performing companies based on market dynamics.

  ### About Dataset:
  The dataset consists of 4 columns, namely

  - S.No - Unique identifier for each entry in the dataset
  - Name - Represents the names of companies
  - Mar Cap-Crore - Market capitalization values for each corresponding entity in crores
  - Sales Qtr-Crore - Indiactes sales figures for each entity, specifically for a quarter

   ### Project Workflow:
   Conducted comprehensive data analysis on a financial dataset using Python. Here are the ateps I followed.

   - Loaded the dataset using pandas, which is a powerful data manipulation and analysi tool in Python. Checking for nulll 
     values or inconsistent data ensuring data reliability and data accuracy
   - Explored the intricate relationship between sales and market capitalization using Python's statistical libraries.
   - Calculated correlation coefficients to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship, providing valuable 
     insights into the company's financial health.
   - Calculated average market capitalization and sales figures, offering a baseline for comparing individual company's
     performance against industry norms.
   - Employed regression analysis to model the relationship between sales and market capitalization, predicting future
     market trends for strategic planning.
   - Identified companies with the highest and lowest market capitalization, offering insights into market leaders
     and potential investment risks.
   - Profiled companies with the highest quarterly sales, pinpointing robust sales strategies and market adaptability.
   - Isolated companies with exceptionally high sales figures, unveiling outliers in the dataset and investigating
     the factors contributing to their exceptional performance.
   - Analyzed top companies with the highest market capitalization, providing a snapshot of industry leaders and market 
     dominance.

  ### Insights:

   Here are the key insights from our Financial Data Analysis:

   - When examining a scatter plot between sales and market capitalization, market capitalization is more when sales are
       between 0-20000 crores!
   - The average market capitalization being significantly higher than the average quarterly sales suggests that these 
       companies are valued quite substantially in the market.
   - A correlation coefficient of 0.6 signifies a moderate positive relationship between sales and market capitalization. 
       This means that, on average, as sales increase, market capitalization tends to increase as well.
   - The average quarterly sales across the dataset amount to approximately ₹3,815.97 Crores.
    
  ### Conclusion:
  
   A comprehensive analysis of market capitalization and quarterly sales data provides valuable insights into the 
   competitive landscape. By understanding these key metrics and meaningful relationships, companies can make informed 
   decisions, refine their strategies, and stay competitive in the dynamic market environment.
